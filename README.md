We understand the challenges of navigating a fast-paced, ever-changing work environment and the impact it can have on mental health. Through continuous learning, growth, and collaboration, we aim to nurture talent and foster a collaborative spirit.

As a group of volunteers from various backgrounds in the South African tech industry, we are dedicated to creating a supportive space for individuals to develop and navigate the challenges of the contemporary work place.

We achieve this through podcasts, online talks, in-person events and workshops by leveraging the knowledge of domain experts who share their insights with our community.
